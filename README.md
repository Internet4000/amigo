# Week of the Amigo - a turn-based strategy game

1. Intro screen (moving bg film, image and text)

Week of the Amigo is a turn-based strategy game with a twist. Just having moved to Land of the Uhuru, you're faced with a dire ultimatum. Find and free the princess in seven days, or perish.

2. Fade to character screen

Who are you? Tell us who you are and we'll determine your ability to succeed.

**this affects the skill of the character**

3. Clear interface

You have seven days, fourteen moves. Every day you'll have time for two moves. Decide wisely, develop your character and fight your way to the princess.

## Game mechanics

Besides the fact that i enjoy turn-based strategy, developing a game with turns will force us to limit ourselves and will make it easier to develop. I'm thinking Heroes of Might and Magic 3 meets tower defense meets Hearthstone meets Dopewars meets Hitman for iPad. I'd like to combine different elements of strategy from those games into what will become Week of the Amigo.

You play as 'The Amigo' and I'm not sure what the goal is though it could involve a princess and other dangerous things. Leveling, experience and time. You have one week to complete the game. A day could be a turn or it could be divided into several turns, like two or four a day. It should be short? Every turn certain events happen. Your move plays out, the world responds, you see the results and plan your next move. Rinse and repeat. Between moves you can upgrade your character, items or buildings.

## Inspiration

XCOM, Anomaly 1/2, Metal Gear Solid, Hitman for iPad, Kingdom Rush (android), Heroes of Might and Magic 3, Risk, Chess, Civilization, Dopewars, Hearthstone, Starcraft, Worms.
